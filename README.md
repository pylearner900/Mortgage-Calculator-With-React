# 🏠 Mortgage Calculator – Lloyds Banking Group Forage Simulation

This project was developed as part of a **job simulation task provided by Lloyds Banking Group on the Forage platform**. The aim was to enhance customer experience by addressing real-world usability issues reported by customers regarding the mortgage calculator tool.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- ❌ Confusing terminology and technical jargon  
- ❌ Cluttered layout and difficult navigation

- **CSS** – Custom styling for layout and UI  
- **Bootstrap** – For responsive and consistent design elements  

## 💡 Key Learnings
